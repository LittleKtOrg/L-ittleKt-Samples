## LittleKt - Samples

A few simple WebGPU samples to show off various features of [LittleKt](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt). You must use a browser that has WebGPU support and enabled (Chrome, Edge). Firefox supports WebGPU but needs to be enabled. If you do not see anything when viewing the samples, then most likely, the browser being used does not support WebGPU.
